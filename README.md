This repository is a Python turtle race game, inspired by the Raspberry Pi foundation's more simplicated game. To install,
simply clone this repository and run it at the command line or in an IDE. This game was developed using Python 3.7.10, and will 
work best using this version. No extra libraries are needed as the turtle module is included with Python.
